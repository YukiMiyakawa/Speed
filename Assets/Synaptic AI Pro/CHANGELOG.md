  - Setup Window button: "Complete MCP Setup"

- **unity_capture_grid**: Auto-split Game View into grid and capture all cells
  - Grid sizes: "2x2", "3x3", "4x4", up to "5x5"
  - Each cell saved as separate file with position info (basename_r0_c0.png, etc.)
  - Perfect for systematic UI analysis and debugging
  - Works with Canvas Overlay UI

- **unity_capture_ui_element**: Capture specific UI element by GameObject name
  - Automatically finds element and calculates screen bounds
  - Works with all Canvas render modes (Overlay, Camera, World Space)
  - No need to manually specify coordinates
  - Example: `elementName: "MoveButton"` captures just that button

- **unity_get_screenshot_result**: Async result retrieval for Play mode captures
  - Call after 3 seconds when capture returns `"status": "pending"`
  - Returns screenshot path, width, height
  - Works with all async capture operations

### Fixed
- **Screenshot Capture**: Complete overhaul of all screenshot tools to properly capture Canvas/UI
  - **CaptureGameView**:
    - Automatically enters Play mode if needed to capture Canvas Overlay
    - 60-frame wait for rendering stabilization before capture
    - Captures at native Game View resolution (fixed 3024x40 bug)
    - Exits Play mode automatically after capture
    - MCP tool description enhanced to force LLM to wait 3 seconds
  - **CaptureRegion**:
    - Game View mode now requires Play mode for Canvas Overlay capture
    - Captures full screenshot then extracts specified region
    - Uses actual screenshot dimensions instead of fixed resolution
    - Correctly captures Canvas elements in all render modes
  - **CaptureUIElement**:
    - Fixed Canvas Overlay coordinate conversion (use GetWorldCorners directly)
    - Fixed Y-coordinate inversion bug (both GetWorldCorners and GetPixels use bottom-left origin)
    - Added dimension validation before texture creation
    - Added debug logging for troubleshooting
  - **All Capture Tools**:
    - Auto-append .png extension if not specified
    - Case-insensitive extension check
    - Improved error messages

### Technical Details
- **60-Frame Wait Mechanism**: `ScreenshotFrameUpdate()` method ensures UI is fully rendered
- **EditorPrefs State Persistence**: Survives domain reload when entering Play mode
- **Canvas Overlay Support**: Direct coordinate usage without WorldToScreenPoint conversion
- **Y-Coordinate Fix**: No coordinate transformation needed (both systems use bottom-left origin)
- **Async Workflow**: LLM instructions updated to "WAIT EXACTLY 3 SECONDS" before result retrieval
- All screenshot tools now use proper resolution detection
- Canvas Overlay (Screen Space - Overlay) now correctly captured in Play mode
- Canvas Camera and World Space modes work in both Edit and Play mode
